To develop a Flappy Bird game using JavaScript, you’ll need the following:

1. Technologies & Tools

HTML5 → For creating the game canvas.
CSS3 → For basic styling (optional).
JavaScript (ES6) → For game logic, physics, and event handling.
Canvas API → To draw and animate the game elements.

2. Key Game Components

Game Loop → To update game state and redraw elements.
Gravity & Physics → To make the bird fall naturally.
User Input Handling → Detect spacebar or click to make the bird jump.
Obstacle Generation → Randomly spawning pipes at intervals.
Collision Detection → Check if the bird hits a pipe or the ground.
Score System → Track how many pipes the player has passed.
Game Over Logic → Stop the game when the bird crashes.

3. Development Setup

A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).
A browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) for testing.
A local server (optional, for better performance).
4. Optional Enhancements
Sound effects and background music.
Animated bird and pipe movement.
Difficulty scaling (speed increases over time).
